/*

In Mongoose, pre('save') is a middleware hook ‚Äî which means it runs automatically before the document is saved to the database.





This is a middleware hook that runs before saving a user to the database:

It checks if the password field is modified. If not, it skips hashing.

If yes, it generates a salt and hashes the password using bcrypt, replacing the original plain text password.

So the database never stores the user's actual password ‚Äî only a secure, hashed version. üîê
